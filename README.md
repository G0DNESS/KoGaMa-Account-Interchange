The **KoGaMa Account Interchange** is a webpage for selling and getting accounts from an online game called KoGaMa. All the accounts in this webpage is only for the WWW server.

Getting an account is very simple, all you have to do is pick any account from the list. You can filter them out by newest account created on KoGaMa or oldest and Developer accounts (accounts created by the webpage owner) and Community accounts (accounts created by users like you).

Selling an account is a little bit more trickier since it checks if you're selling an actual account that you made from KoGaMa rather than just a random username and password you came up with. Just put in an actual username and password and it'll add it to the list.

WARNING:

By selling your account, you are consenting to have your password and username and data stored in our database unless you change the password as it can't be removed unless you contact me directly to remove it. Please think it through whether you want to sell it or not.
